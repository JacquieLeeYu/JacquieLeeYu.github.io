                        I think I first started baking cakes around 2020, when my friend invited me
                        over to bake a cake together. It was a four-layered chocolate cake with a
                        chocolate ganauche coating on the outside. We ended up dusting matcha powder
                        on top for some reason I can't recall, other than the fact that maybe we just
                        had it on hand at the time and thought it was something fancy we could put on.
                        Then, we thought to decorate the outside with canned whipped cream since we
                        saw most cakes looked like that, but sadly, they all deflated quickly. The
                        cake did taste good though, so I'll consider it a success.

                        The next time I made a cake, it was a three-layered cake with a 
                        larger amount of matcha added in on the lower layers. I made this for Mother's
                        Day, which was when we had a big family reunion. Although I did mean
                        to make a giant cake, I didn't mean to make one <i>that</i> big. I used an
                        icing made from cream cheese this time, since I didn't want it to melt halfway
                        through the cake construction like the last cake (although whipped cream not
                        from a can might have worked anyway). The cake itself turned out kind of dense
                        and a little dry, which may be the result of adding so much matcha powder in
                        the first place, though this did not deter me from trying more matcha flavored
                        desserts in the future.

                        This time, I tried to make a single layer matcha cake, with a bit of cocoa
                        powder sprinkled on top of the cake to see if it worked well together (it
                        did not). I think I once again failed to incorporate matcha powder into the
                        recipe, as the bottom of the cake was dense and still too dry. I'm not sure
                        what possessed me to make such a weird cake, but I think I was just feeling
                        like making a cake that day. I did use whipped cream as the icing this time,
                        since the other types of icing (butter and cream cheese) were way too
                        flavorful for my tastes. In fact, most of my cake icings from now on are
                        made from heavy cream for its mildly sweet flavor.

                        The cake I made this time was created to see just how little I could put into
                        a cake and have it still taste good. The base cake layers were made the same
                        way, but I did as little frosting as possible (though I did add cocoa powder
                        because I felt like it). I put a very thin layer of icing between the two
                        layers, and did the same for the outsides as well. My family dislikes cakes
                        with too much sweetness (like a full chocolate cake), so I wanted to check
                        if just cocoa powder dusted on top would work for a "chocolate" cake. The
                        short answer? yes but also no. The long answer? Although the cocoa powder
                        worked for tasting like chocolate, it has to sit on your tongue before you
                        can taste it. The cocoa powder is also only on the top of the cake, so if
                        you only bite the bottom layer, you just get your standard, vanilla cake.
                        I think the only saving point for this cake was the fact that the cake
                        layers were really well done and nicely moist, to the point that it made
                        up for the measly droplet of icing between the cake layers. Altogether, I
                        think this cake is a 5/10, though it was a nice learning experience.

                        This time, I decided I wanted to make tiramisu, one of my top two most
                        favorite cake. It was my first time making tiramisu, so when I read
                        that making tiramisu required raw egg yolk, a kind of cheese, and
                        alcohol, I was a little more than shocked. No one had ever told me
                        tiramisu had alcohol in it, let alone raw egg yolk and cheese. Which,
                        now that I think about it, I feel like bakeries should put up a sign
                        or something so little kids don't eat it like I did (or maybe store)
                        tiramisu don't have alcohol in it? I dont' know). But nevertheless, I
                        baked the cake layers, which were the standard no flavor cakes I make,
                        dipped them in an espresso and cognac mix, and stacked them on top of
                        each other with mascarpone, egg yolk, and heavy cream in between. Put
                        it all together and you create tiramisu! I covered the top with espresso
                        powder, and then left it in the fridge to cool overnight. When I took it
                        back out to try the next day, I realized two things: one, stacking the
                        tiramisu inside a solid cake pan was a bad idea, and two, I think I just
                        made the best cake in my life. I carefully took out a slice of tiramisu
                        and took a bite. It was the most amazing bite of tiramisu I've ever had,
                        and I don't know if it really was or if I'm biased towards my own cake
                        creation, but I polished that plate within two minutes. The only thing
                        that I would improve now that I've made more since (you'll see below), is
                        that I should really dip the cake in more espresso and cognac.
