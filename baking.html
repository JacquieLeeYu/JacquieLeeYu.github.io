                        I think I first started baking cakes around 2020, when my friend invited me
                        over to bake a cake together. It was a four-layered chocolate cake with a
                        chocolate ganache coating on the outside. We ended up dusting matcha powder
                        on top for some reason I can't recall, other than the fact that maybe we just
                        had it on hand at the time and thought it was something fancy we could put on.
                        Then, we thought to decorate the outside with canned whipped cream since we
                        saw most cakes looked like that, but sadly, they all deflated quickly. The
                        cake did taste good though, so I'll consider it a success.

                        The next time I made a cake, it was a three-layered cake with a 
                        larger amount of matcha added in on the lower layers. I made this for Mother's
                        Day, which was when we had a big family reunion. Although I did mean
                        to make a giant cake, I didn't mean to make one <i>that</i> big. I used an
                        icing made from cream cheese this time, since I didn't want it to melt halfway
                        through the cake construction like the last cake (although whipped cream not
                        from a can might have worked anyway). The cake itself turned out kind of dense
                        and a little dry, which may be the result of adding so much matcha powder in
                        the first place, though this did not deter me from trying more matcha flavored
                        desserts in the future.

                        This time, I tried to make a single layer matcha cake, with a bit of cocoa
                        powder sprinkled on top of the cake to see if it worked well together (it
                        did not). I think I once again failed to incorporate matcha powder into the
                        recipe, as the bottom of the cake was dense and still too dry. I'm not sure
                        what possessed me to make such a weird cake, but I think I was just feeling
                        like making a cake that day. I did use whipped cream as the icing this time,
                        since the other types of icing (butter and cream cheese) were way too
                        flavorful for my tastes. In fact, most of my cake icings from now on are
                        made from heavy cream for its mildly sweet flavor.

                        The cake I made this time was created to see just how little I could put into
                        a cake and have it still taste good. The base cake layers were made the same
                        way, but I did as little frosting as possible (though I did add cocoa powder
                        because I felt like it). I put a very thin layer of icing between the two
                        layers, and did the same for the outsides as well. My family dislikes cakes
                        with too much sweetness (like a full chocolate cake), so I wanted to check
                        if just cocoa powder dusted on top would work for a "chocolate" cake. The
                        short answer? yes but also no. The long answer? Although the cocoa powder
                        worked for tasting like chocolate, it has to sit on your tongue before you
                        can taste it. The cocoa powder is also only on the top of the cake, so if
                        you only bite the bottom layer, you just get your standard, vanilla cake.
                        I think the only saving point for this cake was the fact that the cake
                        layers were really well done and nicely moist, to the point that it made
                        up for the measly droplet of icing between the cake layers. Altogether, I
                        think this cake is a 5/10, though it was a nice learning experience.

                        This time, I decided I wanted to make tiramisu, one of my top two most
                        favorite cake. It was my first time making tiramisu, so when I read
                        that making tiramisu required raw egg yolk, a kind of cheese, and
                        alcohol, I was a little more than shocked. No one had ever told me
                        tiramisu had alcohol in it, let alone raw egg yolk and cheese. Which,
                        now that I think about it, I feel like bakeries should put up a sign
                        or something so little kids don't eat it like I did (or maybe store)
                        tiramisu don't have alcohol in it? I dont' know). But nevertheless, I
                        baked the cake layers, which were the standard no flavor cakes I make,
                        dipped them in an espresso and cognac mix, and stacked them on top of
                        each other with mascarpone, egg yolk, and heavy cream in between. Put
                        it all together and you create tiramisu! I covered the top with espresso
                        powder, and then left it in the fridge to cool overnight. When I took it
                        back out to try the next day, I realized two things: one, stacking the
                        tiramisu inside a solid cake pan was a bad idea, and two, I think I just
                        made the best cake in my life. I carefully took out a slice of tiramisu
                        and took a bite. It was the most amazing bite of tiramisu I've ever had,
                        and I don't know if it really was or if I'm biased towards my own cake
                        creation, but I polished that plate within two minutes. The only thing
                        that I would improve now that I've made more since (you'll see below), is
                        that I should really dip the cake in more espresso and cognac.

                        Next, I made a strawberry cake and tiramisu cake to celebrate my grandma's birthday.
                        The strawberry cake was just a simple vanilla base with strawberries lining the
                        space between the two cake layers and along the outside icing. The tiramisu cake is
                        pretty much the same, though I did increase the amount of cognac and espresso added
                        to the cake and I built the cake without the cake pan. I thought since the recipe
                        asked for me to build it in a cake pan, the tiramisu would collapse if I tried to
                        stack it, but it seemed completely fine, so I made all my other tiramisu without it
                        afterwards. As for the strawberry cake, the reason I didn't add too many other things
                        to it was to make it easier for my grandma to eat, since she doesn't typically like
                        to eat cakes that are overly sweet or had too many small things in it. So, when I saw
                        her eating my cake, I was very happy! Watching people eating lots of my food is the
                        best feeling, because it's the perfect way to compliment a chef without telling them
                        explicitly.

                        This time, I made a smaller strawberry cake, since I was feeling like making slightly
                        sweet but also tart as a little cool snack for the summer heat. Since I was living in
                        my apartment just ourside Purdue, I just made a 6 inch cake so that I could finish it
                        by myself without wasting any of it. I was experimenting with how I should place the
                        strawberries and if I should cut them or not. Here, I cut them in half and then in
                        half again when slicing the cake open. That way, you could see a nice cut of the
                        strawberry instead of just white cream. To know where to cut, I lined the strawberries
                        on top of the cake so that the middle of the space between them was where you were
                        meant to cut. It also helps that even if I forgot that it was a marker, I would be
                        more likely to cut between the strawberries instead of cutting the fruit itself in
                        half. So I think this kind of strawberry lining pattern is quite nice (though it
                        would look better if the cake was bigger).

                        This cake was actually a birthday present for one of my friends at Purdue. I made
                        her her favorite chocolate mousse cake with a chocolate ganache coating and dark
                        and white chocolate shavings on top. This was also my first time making it, but I
                        think it really turned out a lot better than I thought it would! I used the recipe
                        that is on the back of every Hershey's cocoa powder to make the chocolate cake layer,
                        and then I made the chocolate mousse. I had never used so much chocolate in my life,
                        but this chocolate mousse required a lot more chocolate than I ever thought it
                        could contain, but <i>man</i>, is it absolutely delicious! Even during the making of
                        the chocolate mousse, I had such a hard time not just eating the mousse straight out
                        of the bowl. Thankfully, I reigned myself back in and finished stacking the cake.
                        When it came time to pour the ganache on top, I was so scared I was going to ruin all
                        the previous hard work, I had to triple check that everything was correct before
                        pouring the melted chocolate mix on top. When I revealed the cake to my friend, she
                        was so surprised that it was such an over the top cake (I think she was expecting a
                        small chocolate cake or something) she thought that I bought it at a bakery or 
                        something, which was very lovely way to compliment my cake and it makes me warm inside
                        to hear.

                        Here, I made another tiramisu cake, and although this is the first one depicted here
                        where I made a tiramisu cake in my apartment in Purdue (you can tell because of the
                        small size of the cake) I have actually consistently made tiramisu cake for my
                        friends, since they fell in love with it the first time I served them some. I also
                        like making tiramisu cake, since it's so easy to make it. You just bake the cake
                        layers, assemble the mascarpone icing, and then plop it all on top and wait four or
                        five hours. The simplicity of it brought me to make it over and over whenever I
                        wanted a slight sweet and slightly bitter treat after classes were over. It is also
                        my favorite cake, so I may have gained weight eating so much tiramisu cake, to my
                        disappointment.

                        The earliest non-cake cake I made was a swiss roll (or more like an attempt at one)
                        in April of 2020. I was feeling like eating a swiss roll, so I rolled up my sleeves
                        to try my hand at making one. And well, I can say for a fact that swiss rolls are
                        quite hard to nail down. The first time I made this, as seen in the picture to the
                        right, the cake layer is so thin, you might as well be eating a wafer, and the color
                        of it makes you want to throw up on principle. I'm not quite sure if the flavor of
                        the cake was supposed to be chocolate or if I burnt it, since the icing flavor I
                        distinctly remember to be matcha flavor since I apparently had a habit of trying to
                        make it work. I feel like I would remember if I <i>burnt</i> the thing, but I'm also
                        not sure why I would try to make chocolate and matcha work again. The cake also 
                        kept breaking apart as I was working with it, so altogether, this was a failure of
                        a swiss roll. But it will not be the last time I made a swiss roll.

                        After the last one, I figured I should try out something else, like cupcakes. Here,
                        I did in fact successfully create a matcha cupcake (and it was pretty good, too!).
