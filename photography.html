                        I visited London for the first time in October 2022 as a part of a week-long 
                        vacation where I would be in London for the first half of the week and Paris
                        for the latter half. At the recommendation of my sister, I went to many museums
                        and other famous locations throughout the city, including The Tower of London,
                        the London Natural History Museum, and Hyde Park. As is clear with the amount of
                        pictures from Hyde Park, that place was the most enjoyable part of my visit. I
                        think this is proof I'm more of a nature person than a city person.

                        I visited Paris for the first time right after London. My sister and I took the
                        Eurostar train to Paris, and it was the worst because my ears kept on constantly
                        popping the entire ride there. I do like the architecture of Paris quite a lot,
                        and it seems many of the buildings have a beige color, giving the city a warm
                        vibe. Like with London, I also visited the prominent sites in the city, like
                        the Louvre, which was a LOT bigger than I thought it was. Despite the beautiful 
                        sights and delicious food, I do prefer London to Paris, simply because 90% less
                        people smoke in London.

                        look at me as if I was the sight to behold and not them. I guess they don't
                        see a big camera making faint clicking sounds all too often.

                        I visited Japan in July of 2019, and spent most of my time in and around Tokyo,

                        quite clean, though transportation is limited to the subway, since taxi fares
                        are too expensive to take. Most of the time, I just walked everywhere, which
                        led to my feet being sore for nearly all of my time there. All in all, though,
                        Japan is an immensely beautiful place to visit, and I'd like to go again soon.

                        wings and try new things. It's full of ups and downs, but at least I came 
                        out of it with a degree!

                        me to EVER visit this city. January makes sense, since they don't call Chicago
                        "The Windy City" for no reason. Yet, for some reason, for the August I was there,
                        it was sweltering hot and without a single wisp of wind. Very nice architecture,
                        though.
