                        My team and I made this prototype for a scheduling app through my HCI class
                        in Purdue in order to learn the process of designing an app and how certain
                        features will be received by users. The app aims to allow users to
                        quickly communicate and schedule meetings, and we conducted user interviews
                        and studies to design the best app we could. Our digital prototype was
                        created using Figma and can be seen

                    I also made this website called Verse with a team during my Spring 2020's Software Engineering
                    class. In this class, we were supposed to spend the semester building one project while
                    setting milestones and following a sprint format. At the end of the semester, we created
                    Verse, a website that takes in data dumps from popular websites such as Facebook, Google,
                    and Spotify, parses them, and then presents them as a digestible report for the user to read
                    through. This was the first time we tried to use React JS and Django, and there was no
                    shortage of issues trying to set up the darn things, but we persevered and we ended up with 
                    <a href="https://github.com/nguyldo/Verse"id="visibleLink">this</a>
                    as our finished project. We wanted something that could show people popular platforms had a
                    lot more data on us than people would think, and I think a more polished version of this
                    could work in the real world. All in all, this project was a fun ride and I'm proud of what
                    we accomplished.

                        I made this app with my team during BoilerMake's 7th annual hackathon at Purdue.
                        This app was created to analyze symptoms that the user has put into it, and tell
                        them whether or not they had a certain plague that was starting to make headline news.
                        We utilized a Naive Bayes classifier and 2000 sets of training data to train the app,
                        and though the outcome of the process could have been better, I'd say it was a good
                        first effort in combining Python code with Javascript.
